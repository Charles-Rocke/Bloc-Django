# product focus
Authentication APIs that allow secure and frictionless signups and logins for end users

# why?
Many developer tools require creating accounts that are tedius to make. Returning to a site is really annoying if I forgot to put my password into my password manager.
When adding an account to the manager it takes a annoying amount of time to create the account (especially if I don't ever return after that)
